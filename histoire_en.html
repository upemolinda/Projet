<h3>The history of Olinda</h3>
<p>In 1534, the Portuguese Crown established the regime of hereditary captainships.</br>
The Pernambuco Harbour Master's Office was delivered to the Portuguese nobleman Duarte Coelho, who took </br>
possession of his position as captain by disembarking, on March 9, 1535, in the factory founded </br>
in 1516, between Pernambuco and Itamaracá. Shortly thereafter, he headed south </br>
looking for a place to settle. He found a strategically ideal location, </br>
high in the hills, where there was a small village called Marim, by the Indians, there </br>
setting up the village that gave birth to Olinda.</br>
<img id="ville" src="ville.jpg"></br>
A place protected by the height revealing the sea, with a natural port formed by reefs, </br>
abundant water and fertile land, and easy to defend, by military standards </br>
of the time. The place was so pleasant that, it is said, Olinda's name came from a sentence </br>
pronounced by Duarte Coelho: "Ó linda situação para se construir uma vila" which can be </br>
to translate as "O the beautiful situation to build a city". On the day of </br>
the foundation of Olinda is not known; we know that the village has prospered so much that in </br>
In 1537, it was already elevated to the rank of a village. On March 12, 1537, Duarte Coelho sent the king </br>
of Portugal, D. João III, the charter, a letter of donation describing all the places and </br>
improvements in the village of Olinda. On the beaches, the village has been fortified </br>
for defense and from the top of the hills extended to the sea, the port and the interior </br>
where the candy stores were located.</br>
</br>
With the extraction of Brazilian wood and the development of sugar cane cultivation, </br>
Olinda became one of the most important shopping centres in the colony, becoming richer </br>
to the point of competing with the Portuguese court in luxury and ostentation. The urban layout of the </br>
village was shaped, still in the 16th century, with the definition of the paths and </br>
the occupation of the main promontories by the religious. With the arrival of the first </br>
religious orders - Carmelites in 1580, Jesuits in 1583, Franciscans in 1585 and Benedictines </br>
in 1586 - there was also the catechesis of the Indians, of fundamental importance for the </br>
definitive conquest of the country.</br>
</br>
On February 16, 1630, the Netherlands invaded Olinda and conquered Pernambuco. Once the </br>
city taken care of, the Dutch settled in the village and the islands near </br>
from the port and abandoned Olinda. On November 24, 1631, the Dutch set fire to Olinda </br>
after removing noble materials from the buildings to build their houses in </br>
Recife, which began to flourish under the Dutch administration. On January 27, 1654, </br>
the Dutch were expelled and the slow reconstruction of the village of Olinda began.</br>
</br>
AFTER 1654 - After 1654, the fate of Recife, which began to </br>
to occupy this place before Olinda. Recife was the headquarters, although unofficial, </br>
and Olinda, detached, slowly rebuilt, no longer having the importance it had in </br>
A map from the mid-19th century reveals a city, a title obtained </br>
in 1676, still the same size as the old town. It is true that their houses </br>
religious were rebuilt in a monumental way. Mercantilism in Recife </br>
and the rationality of this new relationship, in the light of the new world of the 16th and 17th centuries </br>
centuries, finally won. Olinda's future is shaped by the growing importance of </br>
Recife. The (current) historic centre, in the middle of the 19th century, was still surrounded by </br>
rural properties, the largest, the mills, mostly fire mills, those of the plain </br>
floodplain of Beberibe, and the smaller sites, the sites, on the banks of the Beberibe River </br>
and the sea.</br>
</br>
Olinda being a place of houses and where the Academy of Law has been established </br>
since 1827, it has acquired a certain importance in relation to the workplace, Recife. </br>
But it is the interest of healthy sea baths, recommended by doctors, that gives him </br>
a new life. New life that is well represented by the interest of a more </br>
rapid, through an urban train, with Recife, this was done from the crossroads, by </br>
an old road that had existed since the 16th century.</br>
</br>
In principle, holidaymakers used third-party houses rented for the season </br>
summer. Then, real estate is acquired and it becomes a habit of </br>
live in the city, even outside the summer season. It is the rebirth of the city. </br>
This transformation is felt in the houses by the sea, where they are dressed </br>
of eclectic clothing and, with the reforms of the facades, are being modernized. What was </br>
limited to areas near beaches will then move on to other streets in the city. </br>
An urban transformation that brings the old city back to life. Drinking water brought to the </br>
houses by the Santa Teresa company, and the electrification, show the importance of the </br>
reconquest of the city. Soon, the urban train was replaced by the electric tramway </br>
at the beginning of the 20th century.</br>
